    "\n",
    "This analysis explores how consistently users rate anime and examines the potential impact of rating behavior on recommendation quality. Certain users might display extreme rating patterns—such as assigning only maximum (10) or minimum (1) scores—which can distort similarity calculations in collaborative filtering models. By visualizing the distribution of ratings per user and calculating statistical measures like rating entropy, we aim to identify these outlier behaviors. Consistency in ratings is expected to improve recommendation accuracy, while inconsistent rating patterns may introduce bias into both user-based and item-based filtering methods. The results of this step will inform whether preprocessing—such as down-weighting or filtering inconsistent raters—can enhance the overall performance of our recommendation engine."

    "We begin the exploratory analysis by visualizing how anime rating scores are distributed across different user statuses (e.g., completed, dropped, watching).  \n",

    "   - Most user ratings are in the high range (7–9).  \n",
    "   - Very low ratings (<4) are rare.  \n",
    "- **Score Distribution by User Status**  \n",
    "   - **Completed** entries dominate across nearly all rating values, especially at round scores (6, 8, 10).  \n",
    "   - **Watching**, **Dropped**, and **On Hold** appear far less frequently and have flatter distributions.  \n",
    "- **Average Score by Status**  \n",
    "   - **Watching** status has the highest average score.  \n",
    "   - **Dropped** status has the lowest average.  \n",
    "   - **Completed** and **On Hold** are close to each other.  \n",

While these insights help understand data quality, they don’t answer the core practical question: How can we use the ratings by users for generating personalized anime recommendations? Building on the insights from Question 1, this section focuses on item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) to recommend animes based on similarities between titles. Compared to user-based methods, IBCF provides greater stability and scalability by relying on item similarity rather than user similarity.
